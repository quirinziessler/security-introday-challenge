# Security Introday Coding Challenge

## The challenge

Here is a badly written application with many flaws.

Your task is to:

1. Study the application **as a whole** and identify the flaws. Try to fix as many of them as possible*.
2. Containerize the application. 
    ->Dockerfile 
    ```bash
    docker build --tag security-introday-challenge .
    ```
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name=security-introday-challenge security-introday-challenge
    ```
    ```bash
    docker stop security-introday-challenge
    ```
    ```bash
    docker start security-introday-challenge
    ```
3. Present the improved application and show us the changes you made.

Notes: \*Some flaws cannot be fixed immediately. Document them and explain why they are bad and what will you change.
